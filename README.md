An open-source AI agent framework integrated with Gemini and Google

## What is Agent Development Kit?Â¶
Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. ADK can be used with popular LLMs and open-source generative AI tools and is designed with a focus on tight integration with the Google ecosystem and Gemini models. ADK makes it easy to get started with simple agents powered by Gemini models and Google AI tools while providing the control and structure needed for more complex agent architectures and orchestration.
